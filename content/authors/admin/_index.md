I am an ecologist with an abiding interest in understanding, solving and chronicling contemporary conservation and sustainability challenges. My focus has been on tropcial systems shaped by reciprocal human-environment interactions, such as agroecosystems in India and rangelands in eastern Africa. Using statistical models and simulations I try to understand the drivers of sustainability and conservation challenges within these landscapes, and how these challenges will evolve in the future under novel social and environmental conditions. I also write stories, journalistic pieces, and interactive web applications, to communicate more widely about the  daunting but surmountable challenges that affect the wellbeing of people and the non-human world.
